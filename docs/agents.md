# Agents

[Models](models.md) | [Skills](skills.md) | Agents | [Workflows](workflows.md)


Notes:
- Creating Agents is optional, but recommended: I also can (and need) to define the Agent in each Workflow. The "Agents" tab provides a way to create blueprints that can be imported into Workflows.
- Changes made to an Agent inside the "Agents" tab do not affect existing Workflows! I.e. those changes only change the Agent-blueprint for new Workflows.
