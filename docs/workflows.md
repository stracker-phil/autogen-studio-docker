# Workflows

[Models](models.md) | [Skills](skills.md) | [Agents](agents.md) | Workflows

A Workflow is the final definition that combines Agents, Skills and Models. It's like a "team" where each member has a different mindset and abilities.
In the Playground, such a team can be assigned a common task via the prompt.

Note:
- Agents, Skills, and Models are not referenced, but _copied_ into the Workflow configuration upon creation. When either element changes, I need to manually remove & re-add it to the workflow to propagate the changes.
